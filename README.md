## My process

first pixel perfect layout
redux store and functionality
drag n drop

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- I think the logic behind Todo App as a small CRUD Application turns it into a good practice project for learning Redux.
- Beside that I'm going to rewrite the .jsx to .tsx. As an introduction to TypeScript.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Drag'n'Drop with mouse events](https://javascript.info/mouse-drag-and-drop) - This helped me understand the logic behind Drag and Drop feature.
